1. Created a CloudFormation template that builds IAM roles with policies & tags.
 
2. Tested the CFN template by deploying a test stack to ensure it works.
 
3. Created a Service Catalog Portfolio in the root account.
 
4. Created a Product using the CFN template (uploaded locally).
 
5. Added the Product to the Portfolio so it becomes accessible through that portfolio.
 
6. Created an SC-Launch-Role (Launch Constraint Role) that Service Catalog uses to deploy stacks.
 
7. Updated SC-Launch-Role IAM policy to include CloudFormation + IAM + S3 permissions needed for product launches.
 
8. Added Trust Policy so Service Catalog can assume SC-Launch-Role.
 
9. Created a Launch Constraint inside the Portfolio linking the product to SC-Launch-Role.
 
10. Granted Portfolio access to an IAM User (NewUser) so they can view and launch the product.
 
11. Logged in as IAM User using AWS CLI to verify identity and permissions.
 
12. Fixed missing S3 permissions because Service Catalog internally stores artifacts in S3 even if uploaded locally.
 
13. Successfully launched the product from the IAM user account with no further permission errors.
